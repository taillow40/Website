                     <img src="HVPE.png" alt="HVPE">Most recently I worked for the Help Desk Team at Harbourvest Private Equity. <br>

            Here my projects included a powershell script to automate the approval and removal process of O365 licenses from contractors,
            
            as well as a webscraping tool to get and format data from samanage. See: #Projects-Webscraper. While I wasn't writing scrips, I was helping users with any tech issues they may have, ranging form

            fixing BSOD issues to adjusting users timezones in outlook. Through this, I was able to meet a huge number of people within the company and I really enjoyed talking to everyone and asking about what they were working on. 
            Since it is a private equity company, a lot of the financial terms began as very foreign to me but I gradually got an understanding of them. 

            Outside of harbourvest I also work 2-3 hours a week as a professional tutor for Academics etc. I've worked here since august of 2020 and through this, I have 
            I have gained a strong understanding not just of how to teach, but also how to teach someone how to do something with a deep understanding, and also how to give a brief overview.

            In the past I also worked as a CPAs assitant doing '' and as a code sensei during a summer camp at Code Ninjas, teaching kids the fundamentals of programming.

            Through my studies and personal projects I have learned a variety of programming languages, and you can find a list of the languages and what I used them for here:
            Python: various scripts, including basic Artificial Intelligence 
            C#: World of Blocks, Cursed
            C: Linux FileSystem, Linux Shell
            Java: Image Processor
            Javascript: WebScraper, Food Scheduler
            Lua: Minecraft Robots
            Html/css: Here!
            ACL2 (Applicable Common Lisp): Digitally proving mathematical theorems


            You can find a list of the projects 
            In my personal time, I play for my schools Overwatch esport team, and while back in california enjoy surfing and underwater photography,
