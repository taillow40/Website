            Most recently I worked Automation for the Help Desk Team at Harbourvest Private Equity. <br>

            Here my projects included a powershell script to automate the approval and removal process of O365 licenses from contractors,
            
            as well as a webscraping tool to get and format data from samanage. See: #Projects-Webscraper. While I wasn't writing scrips, I was helping users with any tech issues they may have, ranging form

            fixing BSOD issues to adjusting users timezones in outlook. Through this, I was able to meet a huge number of people within the company and I really enjoyed talking to everyone and asking about what they were working on. 
            Since it is a private equity company, a lot of the financial terms began as very foreign to me but I gradually got an understanding of them. 
            
            
            Outside of harbourvest I also work 2-3 hours a week as a professional tutor for Academics etc. I've worked here since august of 2020 and through this, I have 
            I have gained a strong understanding not just of how to teach, but also how to teach someone how to do something with a deep understanding, and also how to give a brief overview.

            In the past I also worked as a CPAs assitant doing '' and as a code sensei during a summer camp at Code Ninjas, teaching kids the fundamentals of programming.
