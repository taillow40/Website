            Overwatch rank webscraper
            Most overwatch tournaments are hosted on a website called gamebattles,
            and through this website we are able to find the usernames of the players on the enemy teams. What my
            webscraper does
            is take a team link from this website, and then it scrapes the usernames from this link, and then
            references a data base called Overbuff
            that keeps track of the ranks of all overwatch players. Thus my webscraper is able to create a short
            summary of teams we'll be facing in tournaments.

            World of Blocks
            World of blocks is a game designed in unity for ios. The basic premise of the game is that players are
            trying to knock all blocks off of a platform.
            It is similar to angry brids in that progression through the game is in the form of
            individual levels, and as you progress further more mechanics are added to the game that make the levels
            more complex, though not neccessarily more difficult.
            I've also created a browser version of the game that can be played here:

            Disabled Users Microsoft 365 licenses
            While working at harbourvest there was a constant shortage of office 365 e5 licenses, but the company
            was hesitant to buy more because
            they compared the number of licenses to the number of active users, and believed we should have plenty
            of licenses We had not been reclaiming
            the licenses from employees no longer working at the firm due to the tedious process of needing to open
            a ticket and request manager approval for
            every single license that needed to be reclaimed.

            To combat this, I along with a member of my team wrote a script in powershell that automated this
            process from start to finish.
            First, it generates a list of users with office licenses that have not signed in for more than 60 days,
            along with their managers.
            Next, it interfaces with solarwinds samanage to create a ticket for each user and automatically requests
            the managers approval (Making sure that it could handle users that don't have managers or aren't setup
            properly)
            Finally, it continuously checks the created tickets for manager approval, and when they get approved for
            removal, it interfaces with Azure Active Directory to remove the license.

            The process is run using a UNKNOWN SCHEDULER and is totally automatic and still in use.

            Linux File System
            In Linux, I created a file system in the user space using fuse that was a basic recreation of the linux
            file system using inodes to map file names to directories.

            Food Planning tool
            Using google sheets I created a tool that would help me schduele and plan the meals I'm cooking. It is a
            sheet split into 2 main pages.
            First, the schedule for the week. This is where I write down what I want to cook each day of the week.
            It then uses references the options page
            to fill in the ingredients I'll need along with how long it took me to cook it the last time I made it.
            The sheet also includes more pages to enhance the functionality.
            Pantry can be used to keep track of what is currently in the frige and pantry and flag anything that
            will need to be bought for the upcoming week.
            Menu is a graphical page with a formatted version of each meal to help me choose what I want to cook.
            Settings is a page that gives some customization for various settings.

            Linux Shell
            in linux in C I built a simple shell that allows for the execution of commands. It provided support for
            command execution,
            i/o redirection, and pipes, as well as sequential, conditional, and background command execution.

            Tech Share
            For a hackathon I competed on a team of 4 to create a website that helped connect people together so
            they could share old technology
            such as the Wii. I programmed on the backend setting up a database using firebase.

            Cursed
            Along with 3 other people I competed in a week long Game Jam for Northeastern. Our game was cursed, and
            the basic premise was that we needed to cooperate with the main character
            to help them navigate through a variety of games. As the game progessed, it got more and more difficult
            to play. There would be "curses" on the player
            and things would start happening, the mouse would jump around, programs wouldn't cooperate, and the game
            became more difficult to play.

            Battlecode
            I competed along with 3 other people in MIT's battle code 2022. During this competition we programmed
            rules based AI to play a real time strategy game.
