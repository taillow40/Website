<br>Welcome to Statisticize!<br>

This is a game about knowing your opponent.<br><br>

Go to the link: https://taillow40.github.io/Website/UniqueID  <br>
Use the same UniqueID as the people you're playing with. <br>
<br>

The getquestion button will give a new question and whether the high answer or low answer will win, only one person needs to click the button!<br>
<br>
Each person thinks about their answer and then goes around in a circle saying their answer, whoever has the corresponding highest or lowest answer wins and gains a point. <br>

<br>--------------------------------------------Betting Variant------------------------------------------------<br>

In this version of the game, before revealing answers people will bet. <br><br>

Each person starts with $100. Before revealing answers, one person will start by stating their bet, and every successive person can choose to either call their bet, fold and not call their bet, or raise and increase the bet. After every player has either called the current bet or folded, players reveal their numbers and whoever wins takes all the money that has been bet. <br>
<br>
Fold: Player can’t win money, and any money they have previously bet is lost, but they won’t lose more money.<br>
Call: Match the last bet, players can win money if they have the winning number.<br>
Raise: Increase the bet, all players must either call the new bet or fold. <br>
<br>
A few notes:<br><br>
If player A bets $10 and player B raises to $20. Then player A can choose to match the $20, or fold. If they fold then player B takes their initial bet of $10.<br>
<br>
Reraising is not allowed. Ex: player A bets $10 and player B raises to $20, player A can either choose to fold, or call the $20. They can not “reraise” to $30. <br>
